# Whisper Foiling Catamaran in Biscayne Bay, Miami, FL

In November 2016 I got my hands on a Whisper Foiling Catamaran from WhiteFormula UK. A cool foiling catamaran. Although I had been sailing since a kid on all sorts of boats, including catamarans, I had no experience with a current high performance catamaran.

A state of the art performance catamaran has lots of tricks and details; a foiling boat has a few more. These notes cover the adventures of this Miami-based captain and crew in figuring out a powerful boat.

## Things we learn about the boat

### Standing and lowering a mast

You can stand and lower the mast with just two people. The technique is seen in this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxctIJVOAd0 ; instead of the forestay, we use the trapeze wires, extended with ropes that we run through pulleys attached at the bridle wire hooking points, and made fast in the cleats available near the mast.

We put the boat on an incline, on the beach dolly just aft of the foils, stern on the ground.

Captain will push the mast up, similar to the video, all the way through. Crew starts holding the mast down so it doesn't snap off the ball. Once the mast has some angle, crew moves from holding the mast down to pulling the lines; this stabilizes the mast and gives the capt a break between pushes. 

### Rig tension

* _Why does the manual say: first the the rake, and *then* set the tension with the under-the-trampoline rig? How can one get decent tension pulling with bare hands?_
* Will be installing stay plates li

### Foils

* White Formula ships the bungees in the foils untied so they don't stretch. You must pull them a bit tight and make a knot.
* _How do you assess / set the trim for ride height with the foils inserted and out of the water???_

### Rudders

* The rudders are not identical! The hole for the pin only lines up when you've put them right. We found this (and fixed this) when we were deep in the water. 

### Main / Boom

* Hoisting/lowering is similar to many hobies and nacras -- there's a ring on the halyard, and a hook on the mast. This may need some practice and/or adjustments. 
* The Harken ratchamatic block wears out. Harken may offer replacement. 


## Things we learn about sailing it

* The ratchamatic block position doesn't give enough grip (the sheet doesn't wrap around it enough) when held by the crew standing a bit forward.
* Running aground is a PITA. The foils are very sturdy however, and our sandy/grassy bottom has not damaged them.
* Really needs a beach to handle all the foil setup. Ramps have not been practical so far; and the foils extending outwards make any dock approach dangeorous.
