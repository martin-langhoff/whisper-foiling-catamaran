# Background

In November 2016 I got my hands on a Whisper Foiling Catamaran from WhiteFormula UK. A cool foiling catamaran. Although I had been sailing since a kid on all sorts of boats, including catamarans, I had no experience with a current high performance catamaran.

A state of the art performance catamaran has lots of tricks and details; a foiling boat has a few more. These notes cover the adventures of this Miami-based captain and crew in figuring out a powerful boat.
